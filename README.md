bloom-harvester
===============

The bloom-harvester is the thing that will make your data collected from 
[little-rabbit](https://github.com/opower/little-rabbit) and [giant-squash](https://github.com/opower/giant-squash)
come to life. 

It's based on the d3.js [Motion Chart](https://github.com/mbostock/bost.ocks.org/blob/gh-pages/mike/nations/index.html) example by
[Mike Bostock](https://github.com/mbostock). In pure lazyness and because I never do javascript 
and front-end work, I used the same data format as Motion Chart was using, for better or worse. 

To see the result of this live, go read [The Story of the Big Data Elders](http://opower.github.io/2013/07/07/the-story-of-the-big-data-elders/) or
watch it rendered live [here](githubpages link). 

If you want to use this, know that you'll need data from both of these projects:
* [litte-rabbit](https://github.com/opower/little-rabbit)
* [giant-squash](https://github.com/opower/giant-squash)

The overview of the solution involving this tool and the aforementioned supporting projects are described
in [The Big Data Elders, Archeology Hour](http://opower.github.io/link-tbd)

Happy harvesting.
